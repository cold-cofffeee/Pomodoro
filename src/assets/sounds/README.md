# Audio Assets

This directory contains the audio files for the Pomodoro application.

## Current Status
âœ… **Placeholder files created** - The app now includes minimal silent audio files to prevent loading errors.

## About These Files
The current audio files (rain.mp3, forest.mp3, etc.) are silent placeholder files. They prevent the "failed to load" errors but don't produce any sound. You can replace them with your own audio files.

## Required Default Sounds:
- **rain.mp3** - Gentle rain sounds
- **forest.mp3** - Forest ambience with birds  
- **ocean.mp3** - Ocean waves
- **campfire.mp3** - Crackling campfire sounds
- **white-noise.mp3** - White noise for focus
- **cafe.mp3** - Coffee shop ambience

## Notification Sounds:
- **notification-complete.mp3** - Session completion sound
- **notification-break.mp3** - Break start sound  
- **notification-focus.mp3** - Focus session start sound
